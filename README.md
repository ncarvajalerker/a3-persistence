## Best Movies Ever

your glitch link e.g. http://a3-nataliacarvajalerker.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application is to list the best movies, and have the user be able to input their favorite movie.
- challenges you faced in realizing the application, including the middleware and the passport requirement.
- what authentication strategy / database you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable) I chose the ones given above by the professor. I foound that passportjs.org was very helpful especially with the resoruces it gave.
- what CSS framework you used and why.
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored. I used buttons, hovering and changing button colors, I added different boxes and seperations to make the webpage look nice. I also have a footnote to make the page look complete.
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does.
